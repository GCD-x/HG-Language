```hg
[CustomElement: Attribute="Value"]
```

### Conditional Rendering

Conditional statements can be used to render content based on specific conditions:

```hg
[IF: Condition]
    [Text: This content will be displayed if the condition is true.]
[ELSE]
    [Text: This content will be displayed if the condition is false.]
[ENDIF]
```

### Scripting

HG supports integration with JavaScript for dynamic content generation and interaction:

```hg
[SCRIPT:
    // JavaScript code here
]
```
